# Create an "initial empty commit" in the repository.
#
# Rationale (munged from what I just wrote at https://github.com/Anacode/cvs2git-wrap/commit/aa1ccd8c36 )
#
# * When viewing commit diffs in gitk, there is no diff for the
#   initial commit. This in turns means that searches for commit
#   "adding/removing string" will not show that commit, even if the
#   initial tree contains the string.
#
# * When grafting a new commit tree onto an existing project, it makes
#   sense to me for both have a common tree at some point.  That point
#   it the initial commit.
#
# * To easily distinguish different repositories from each other, or
#   match up clones, one property that could be useful is the
#   commitid(s) of the set of commits with no parents.
#
#   This is something I do not yet use, but plan to try.
