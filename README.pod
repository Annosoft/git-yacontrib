=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the sort of small Git extension scripts I would keep in
C<~/bin/> and have on my path, or put in C<~/.gitconfig section
[alias]>.  The project is named "mca-wtsi/git-yacontrib".

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 "Throw them in the ~/bin"

The current plan is to "install" them via symlinks,
  ln -snvf ../../../gitwk-github/scripts/bin/{git-rebase-topswap,pidfzap} ~/bin/

or include the bin/ on PATH.

Running the supplied script with

 ./install -y ~/bin

will do this for you, in the way I currently prefer.  You must put
that C<~/bin> on C<PATH> yourself.

=head2 The scary scripts

Some scripts are too destructive to leave lying around on your PATH if
you don't know the name.  These may be installed, as a separate set,
with

 ./install -yS ~/bin

=head2 Details

For "installation" of multiple scripts from some source repositories,
I prefer to symlink a parent directory and then symlink various
scripts through that, so

 ,git-yacontrib -> $HOME/gitwk-ext/git-yacontrib/bin
 git-k -> ,git-yacontrib/git-k
 git-st -> ,git-yacontrib/git-st
  ...

so it's obvious which remaining files (presumably saved straight from
editor to ~/bin) ought to be put in version control.

The set of files installed is defined by F<install*.txt>.

=head1 MAINTENANCE

They are only maintained to the extent that I'm still using them.
You're welcome to fork on Github or by other means, and I would aim to
merge contributions as time allows.


=head1 PLANS & IDEAS

Vapourware.

=head2 git backup-stash

Something to generate a commit which could usefully be included in a
backup, to record more about the repo state, referencing some or all
of

=over 4

=item * all stashes in the reflog

=item * other extant commitids from reflogs

This would allow recovery of not-yet-garbage-collected commits, from
commitid-based repository backups.  Possibly neat, but unlikely to be
useful?

=item * comment or extra file containing the reflog and head stash ref

=item * some of .git/config and related files?

=item * Untracked files.  Call it a tristash (staged, unstaged,
untracked)

Use another index?  Define size limits?

Ignored files?  What about files to exclude for security reasons?

=item * a tar of some .git/ internals

 logs/
 hooks/
 config
 info/exclude
 info/grafts
 COMMIT_EDITMSG
 GITGUI_BCK
 description
 objects/info/alternates

 git-svn state
 gitweb config

 hardlink counts & inode info for packfiles
    In combination with related matching backups could be used to
    reconstruct the hardlinked arrangement.  If you were desperate.

Many of these are things you wouldn't want to just restore.

=back

It will look like a huge merge (but isn't).

Related possibly useful things,

=over 4

=item * operations to reverse these back into reflog & stash, or
extract any one to become the current stash

=item * something that makes this tree clearly not part of the
project.

Empty, except for a shell script to help with the restoration?

=back

Naming

 git stashbranch
 git stash-branch
 git backup-stashes
 git _backup-stashes # we may assume it is called from cron, so avoid eating namespace?


=head1 AUTHOR

I have written them in the course of my work for
http://www.sanger.ac.uk/ and for personal use.

The project is released under GPLv2 or later, per local policy.

(I realise this is far to vague to form a reliable declaration of
"release under GPLv2" except where explicit but marking for release
takes time, and it's probably better to make the thing visible and
wait for someone to ask for clarification.)
